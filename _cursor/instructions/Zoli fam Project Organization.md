## 2. Frontend Organization (Next.js)

### Pages & Routing
- Use Next.js file-based routing:
  - `/pages/index.js` – Landing/Home Page.
  - `/pages/blog/index.js` – Blog Listing Page.
  - `/pages/blog/[slug].js` – Dynamic Blog Detail Page.
  - `/pages/price-list.js` – Price List Page.
  - `/pages/location.js` – Location Page.
  - `/pages/contact.js` – Contact Page.
  - `/pages/promotions.js` – Promotions Page.

### Components
- **Navigation Bar:**  
  - A reusable header for consistent site-wide navigation.
- **Footer:**  
  - Contains social media links and additional navigation elements.
- **Reusable Widgets:**  
  - Cards and components for blog summaries, promotions, and service highlights.
- **Special Components:**  
  - Map preview and WhatsApp QR code components.

### Assets & Styling
- **Assets:**  
  - Store images, icons, and other media in the `/public/assets` folder.
- **Styles:**  
  - Use a CSS-in-JS solution (e.g., styled-components) or a utility-first framework like Tailwind CSS.
