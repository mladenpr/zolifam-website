# Web Flow Document: Ladies Beauty Salon Website

When a user first types in the website address or clicks on a link from an external source, they arrive at the Landing Page. The Landing Page welcomes visitors with a clean layout that displays the most important details about the salon. The visitor sees a brief introduction to the salon, a summary of the price list, the salon location with a small map preview if available, parking information, and the essential contact details. The page also shows current promotions in a dedicated area and features a large WhatsApp QR code that encourages visitors to start a conversation.

The navigation bar is simple and clear. A visitor can move to the Blog section by clicking on the Blog link. This takes them to the Blog Listing page where they find a collection of articles about the services, treatments, and beauty tips the salon offers. Each blog post is summarized with an image, a short description, and a “Read More” link. When the visitor clicks on a specific blog post, they are taken to a Blog Detail page that displays the full article, including information on the treatment or service, images, and any related links.

Back on the Landing Page, visitors have the option to click on different parts of the page to get more detailed information. For example, clicking on the price list section takes them to a dedicated Price List page where all the services along with their prices are displayed in detail. Similarly, clicking on the location information can lead to a separate Location page. This page enlarges the map and provides a more detailed description of the salon’s address, directions, and nearby landmarks. There is also a Contact page that allows visitors to see various methods of communication, including the phone number, email address, and possibly a simple contact form for direct inquiries.

Additionally, the website includes a Promotions page. This page gathers all current and upcoming special offers and events in one place, giving visitors clear information about any deals or incentives available at the salon. At any point, the visitor can use the bottom or side navigation that carries links to social media profiles and the external Fresha booking app, ensuring a smooth transition to those services when needed.

Every page maintains a consistent design and navigation experience. Whether a visitor is browsing the main landing page, diving through detailed service information, or reading a blog post, they experience the same simple and modern style. The journey from one page to another is seamless, making it easy for the visitor to explore all aspects of what the salon offers.
